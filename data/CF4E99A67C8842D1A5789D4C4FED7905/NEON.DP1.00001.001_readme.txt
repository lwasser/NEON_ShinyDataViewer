Data Product Description: Two-dimensional wind speed and direction, available as two- and thirty-minute aggregations of 1 Hz observations.  Observations are made by 2-D sonic anemometer sensors located at multiple heights on the tower infrastructure and by 2-D sonic anemometer sensors located on the aquatic meteorological station.

Download packages available:
basic � Includes the data product , summary statistics, expanded uncertainty,  and final quality flag.
expanded � Includes the basic package information plus quality metrics for all of the quality assessment and quality control analyses.
request � Provided only for a data product�s lowest time resolution. This package includes the expanded package information as well as the outcomes of the individual quality flags at a data product�s native sampling resolution.  

Sensor: Gill - Wind Observer II; Extreme Weather Wind Observer

These data are considered provisional (created using a baseline algorithm approach with a minimal or reduced set of QA/QC checks). Minor updates to the QA/QC and processing algorithms will occur during construction (prior to 2017). Changes to provisional data products will occur on an as-needed basis.  Please check back to this site for updates tracked in change logs.  Query reproducibility on provisional data cannot be guaranteed.
